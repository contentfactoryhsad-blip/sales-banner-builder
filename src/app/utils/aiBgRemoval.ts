// Conservative background removal for product images.
//
// Deliberately NOT ML-based. The `@imgly/background-removal` model kept eating
// white product bodies (a white LG washer/dryer on a white studio background):
// it makes the whole white body transparent in one border-connected sweep, so
// even a connectivity guard can't tell it apart from the real background
// (see memory: feedback_bg_remove_attempts).
//
// The shape of the thing:
//   1. Treat ONLY near-pure-white pixels as erasable background.
//   2. Flood-fill inward from the image border through those white pixels —
//      erase from the OUTSIDE in. Any white region not reachable from the
//      border (a white product panel enclosed by its own darker edges/shadows)
//      is never touched.
//   3. Repair the mask, then feather and de-fringe its edge.
//
// Step 3 is what makes a white product usable. A white body on a white backdrop
// is separated from it by nothing but a faint grey outline, and JPEG noise
// pushes that outline above and below the threshold from one pixel to the next.
// The flood leaks a few pixels into the body wherever the outline reads as
// white, which is the ragged, crinkled edge that made this unusable — not one
// big failure but hundreds of shallow bites.
//
// Those bites are narrow, so morphology closes them: dilate-then-erode bridges
// any notch thinner than twice its radius while leaving the true silhouette
// where it is. It can only ADD product back, never take more away, which is the
// property every earlier attempt at a smarter flood lacked.
//
// Falls back to the original image on any failure.
